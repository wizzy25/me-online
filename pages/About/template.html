        But enough about tech. Self-discovery is of utmost importance to me, as
        much as doing what I love, which is a lot; nature, sports, and
        continuous self-improvement come first. Other interests include, wines,
        rums, photography, hiking, and cycling (just the ones I can think for
        now).
